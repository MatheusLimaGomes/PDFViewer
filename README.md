# PDFViewer
A Example to PDFViewer using UIGraphicsPDFRenderer

This project would exemplify the use of a powerful feature the 'UIGraphicsPDFRenderer',
which features a more concise and comfort to create a component without relying on a WebView or WKWebView,
and its design is not able to use the PDFKit for not being in the build target compatible with that of the framework.
